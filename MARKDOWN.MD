## **Identifying and Defining**

### **Identifying a Need**
#### Game Idea
The game I am going to make is a 2D Platformer with a ninja character, running through a dojo, with a boss fight at the end.

#### Brainstorming
* Ninja getting through obstacles in dojo to become master
* Flappy bird inspired game
* Mario inspired platformer game

#### Need
The need for my game is to repopularise 2D platformers with an engaging and attractive game.

#### Problem Statement
Loss of interest and demand for 2D platformers has been evident. My game addresses this with fun design and unique/challenging obstacles, as well as a boss fight at the end. This will attract and repopularise the 2D platformer genre as a whole.

#### Skill Development
The skills used in my game are all from 

### **Requirements Outline**
#### Inputs
User inputs will include arrow, WASD keys and the spacebar for movement (W key, the up arrow key, and the space bar for jumping), shift button for sprinting, and ctrl button for crouching, mouse button 1 for attacking and pressing button in menu, and mouse button 2 for blocking.

#### Processing
The program will check for collision and calculate the new position of the player.

#### Outputs
The game will display the character's new position, and a game-over message.

#### Transmission
My game will not require any data transmission.

#### Storage
The game will not store any data as there are levels.

### **Functional Requirements**
#### User Interaction
The user interacts using keyboard commands for advanced movement, and mouse clicks for to select/press buttons on the menu/defeat screen resulting in either the game ending or you restart. Mouse clicks are also used for your character to attack or block.

#### Core Gameplay
My game includes mechanics like advanced movement and combat. For the movement, the character will move, the advanced part includes sprinting and crouching. Crouching lowers the players hitbox, and sprinting makes the player run faster. For combat, there is just an attack aand a block button which reflects projectiles.

#### Level Progression
To move onto the next level in my game, you have to get past all the obstacles and get to the end, then you will progress onto the next level.

#### Saving and Loading Data
My project does not save/store data.

### **Non-Functional Requirements Instructions**
#### Performance Requirements
The game should load in under 5 seconds and have low input delay.

#### Usability Requirements
The game should include instructions/tutorials to explain the core mechanics to new users.

#### Compatibility Requirements
The game must be compatible on PC with mouse and keyboard.

#### Scalability Requirements
The game should be able to scale for the addition of new levels and features without impacting performance.
